    <h1>WebAPI Time Calculator:</h1>

    <p>Follow the steps to see the result:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click the "Connect" Button to make sure there is a good Connection</li>
      <li>Enter your user name and your password, Click the "Logon" Button and see the Logon Result</li>
      <li>Once you see the base time in logon result, calculator remembers your base time and you can logoff
      <li>Choose your "From UTC" Time and "To UTC Time" in your local time zone</li>
      <li>Click the "Calculate" Button see the calculated UTC time you should use</li>
      <li>The second calculator calculates milliseconds time in serverMsg into real time</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>0. If you logged on somewhere else and already have the base time, copy and paste it below and continue from the
       step 4 above: the base time looks like '2017-06-10T00:19:29'<input id="base_time_pasted" /> <button id="base_time_save" onclick="basetimeSave()">Save</button></pre>
    <br>
    <input id='url' size="35" value="wss://demoapi.cqg.com:443" style="display:none"/>
    1-3. UserName: <input id='user'value="username"/>
    Password: &nbsp;&nbsp;<input id="pass" value="pass" type="password"/>
    <button id="connect" onclick="connect()">Connect</button>
    <button id="disconnect" onclick="disconnect()" disabled="true">Disconnect</button>
    <span id="state">No Connection</span>
    <button id="logon" onclick="logon()" disabled="true">Logon</button>
    <button id="logoff" onclick="logoff()" disabled="true">Logoff</button>
    <br>
    <pre id="logonresult">Logon Result:</pre>
    <br><br>
    4-5. Select "From UTC Time" and "To UTC Time": (enter your local time)
    <input type="date" id="start-date" value="2017-01-01" required/>
    <input type="time" id="start-time" value="08:00:00" required/> TO
    <input type="date" id="end-date" value="2017-02-01" required/>
    <input type="time" id="end-time" value="09:00:00" required/>
    <button id="CalculateUTC" onclick="calculateUTC()">Calculate</button>
    <p>Calculate Results:</p>
    <pre id="fromutctime"></pre>
    <pre id="toutctime"></pre>
    <br><br>
    <p>6. Type "WebAPI Time" in milliseconds and see the Real UTC/Local Time:<input id="milli-time" value=0 required/>
        <button id="CalculateReal" onclick="calculateReal()">Calculate</button></p>
    <p>Calculate Results:</p>
    <pre id="utctime"></pre>
    <pre id="localtime"></pre>

    <br>
    <p>Tips:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The smallest time interval for Historical request is minutely, for Tick data request is millisecondly</li>
      <li>This example shows the minutely request, users can send millisecondly request as well</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>More about Base Time:</pre>
      <pre>
           Users of the web API might be confused by the inclusion of “basetime” in the proto file. In order to maintain
           non-degradable performance across thousands of connections, our API servers are designed to exploit opportunities
           to eliminate unnecessary computation at every turn. One of the ways we do this is to reduce the integer size of
           our time index. The Unix Epoch, or POSIX time, is January 1, 1970 UTC 00:00:00. Ordinarily, one would use a benchmark
           such as this precise time as the starting point for the time index as is. But since our API users often need to
           request information with at least millisecond precision, a millisecond interval index based on the Unix Epoch gives
           us a value close to 1.5 trillion for the current time, and binary requires 64 bits to express a number that large.
           In order to reduce the index integer to a number small enough to only require 32 bits, we need to move the benchmark
           up to within 2 billion milliseconds (about 23 days) from the current time. Therefore, we arbitrarily reset our API
           “basetime” about every two weeks, and publish that value when the user logs in. In order to send a request specifying
           a time the API server can understand, one must first subtract our “basetime” as represented by the Unix Epoch millisecond
           index from the current time represented by the Unix Epoch. The result will be the number of milliseconds that have elapsed
           since our “basetime”. If you want to get bar data for the last hour, you need to specify the start of the last hour
           based on this new index, so you would find the number of milliseconds to subtract from the current time index based on
           our “basetime”. Assume it is Friday, January 6, in the last few minutes of trading, 3:11 pm Central Time. Your model
           needs the prior two hours of 10 minute bars.
